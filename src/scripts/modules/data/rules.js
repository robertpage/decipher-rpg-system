export const rules = "Rules and instructions for the storyteller: The below is a simple starting story. To play read the above to your players. Players can say any words on their character sheet and you can tell them what happens and how it effects the world around them by using you translation page. Each spell's effects should dicipate when the player says a new spell. Every time someone uses a word check one of the boxes next to that word on your translation page. When the last box is checked for that that word, it disappears for all players and their characters are unable to recall it. This is accomplished in real life by having players cross the exhausted word off of every character sheet. As players guess words they will progress through your story and slowly translate the words based on what happens within the world as they read from their character sheets. Possible places the above story could go. Caves that turn into underground chambers, rogue home elves, goblins, clockwork traps, a magical school furnace that is in fact a trapped demon, a deep gorge with a collapsed bridge, underground lakes with bioluminescent water grass and creatures moving among it. The story is only limited by your imagination!";
